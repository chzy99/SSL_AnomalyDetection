# Anomaly Detection Based on Self-Supervised Learning
Anomaly detection technology has not only been widely used, but also plays an
extremely critical role in financial fraud detection, medical diagnosis and even military
detection. Therefore, the research on anomaly detection has always been increasing. In
recent years, with the vigorous development of deep learning technology, deep anomaly
detection has become a very popular research topic, and more and more mature deep
learning models and algorithms have been applied to various anomaly detection tasks.
This paper firstly studies the former deep anomaly detection work and advanced practical
experience, and makes a detailed analysis of the long-standing challenges and
opportunities in the field of anomaly detection. Then, this paper designs and implements
a deep learning model based on a self-supervised representation learning algorithm and
deep one-class classification. After sufficient experimental verification, this model is
proved to be effective in solving general image anomaly detection problems and has a
performance close to the current state-of-the-art models. Moreover, this paper will
manage to explore the depth of a special anomaly detection application scenario which is
chest X-ray detection of COVID-19 patients, and discuss the adaptability of this model
in this scenario by conducting experiments, and further analyze the advantages and
disadvantages of this model in order to pave the way for subsequent research.
